Quiz App
A fun and interactive quiz application that allows users to test their knowledge across various categories. The app includes a timer for each question, leaderboards to track top scorers, and local storage support for saving user data and scores across sessions. With a smooth, user-friendly interface and multiple quiz categories, this app aims to provide an engaging and challenging experience.

Features
Multiple Categories: Users can choose from a variety of quiz categories, such as General Knowledge, History, Science, Sports, and more.
Timed Questions: Each question comes with a timer, adding a sense of urgency and challenge to the quiz.
Leaderboards: Track the top scores and display them on a leaderboard. The leaderboard is stored in local storage, making sure user progress is saved even after closing the app.
User Profiles: Users can create a profile with their name, country, and age, which is saved in local storage and displayed during the session and on the leaderboard.
Dark Mode: A dark mode toggle to switch between light and dark themes for an improved user experience.
Animations: Enjoy interactive animations like party poppers for correct answers and buzzer sounds for wrong answers.
Local Storage Support: The app utilizes local storage to persist user data, including name, score, and leaderboard, so users don’t lose their progress between sessions.
Technologies Used
React: A declarative and efficient JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
Vite: A fast and lightweight development build tool to serve the app during development and create optimized production builds.
CSS/Styled Components/Tailwind CSS: For styling and layout (whichever styling method is used in your app).
Local Storage API: Used to store user scores and profile information, ensuring data persistence across app sessions.
React Hooks: Utilized for managing state and handling side effects like timer countdowns and leaderboard updates.
Timer: Each question comes with its own countdown timer, adding an extra layer of challenge and excitement.
